# Static Node.js and Express Site

In this project, I've created a gorgeous portfolio site to showcase the great projects I've built. The site contains a modern landing page, an about page with my contact info, and a series of project pages from my Techdegree.

I've created a JSON file to store all the data about the projects I've created.

I've used Pug to utilize the JSON data and generate the markup that is ultimately displayed in the browser.

I've used Node.js and Express to:

Import the required dependencies
Link the JSON with the Pug templates
Set up routes to handle requests
Set up the middleware to utilize static files like CSS
Handle errors
Set up a server to serve the project

I've made my portfolio using AJAX, which makes navigating through the site very fast. I've also changed the fonts, font colors, and the sidebar background as well.
